How I Open the Website:
1. Open XAMPP
2. Start Apache
3. Start MySQL
4. Serve the Server in VSCode using the PHP Server by brapifra

The "Admin" button for MySQL in XAMPP opens phpmyadmin that is used to view and edit the database.

I had some trouble with XAMPP and only got it to work after troubleshooting the errors with random youtube videos and stack overflow posts. If you have trouble idk :)
